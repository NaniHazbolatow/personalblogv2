  - title: Improving L-BFGS with Nesterovâ€™s Momentum in R
    #system-name: 
    gif: assets/img/betteralgo.gif
    status: Still developing ðŸŸ¨
    abstract-less: I am currently developing an enhanced Limited-memory Broydenâ€“Fletcherâ€“Goldfarbâ€“Shanno (L-BFGS) optimization algorithm by incorporating Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) momentum, implemented in R. By combining L-BFGS's efficiency with Nesterov's momentum for faster convergence, the hybrid algorithm aims to improve performance in high-dimensional optimization tasks. 
    abstract-more: By modifying the current state-of-the-art C++ code and porting this code through Rcpp, I expect to see moderate performance gains while retaining the stability of L-BFGS.

    status: Finished ðŸŸ© 
    abstract-less: As a data scientist at Ipsos Netherlands, I contributed to the Exit Poll for the 2023 Dutch General elections in collaboration with a senior data scientist. The combination of strategic sample selection, historical data modeling, stakeholder collaboration, and technical enhancements culminated in a robust and reliable exit poll model for the 2023 Dutch General elections, despite the challenges posed by the historical data being from 2021, a period marked by the COVID-19 pandemic.
