    status: Still developing ðŸŸ¨
    abstract-less: I am currently developing an enhanced Limited-memory Broydenâ€“Fletcherâ€“Goldfarbâ€“Shanno (L-BFGS) optimization algorithm by incorporating Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) momentum, implemented in R. By combining L-BFGS's efficiency with Nesterov's momentum for faster convergence, the hybrid algorithm aims to improve performance in high-dimensional optimization tasks. 
    abstract-more: By modifying the current state-of-the-art C++ code and porting this code through Rcpp, I expect to see moderate performance gains while retaining the stability of L-BFGS.
