# about me
first-paragraph:  Hi, welcome to my landing page! 
# I am currently a first-year Computational Science graduate student at the <a href="https://www.uva.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Amsterdam</a> and the <a href="https://www.vu.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free University of Amsterdam</a>. Next to my studies, I work part-time as a data scientist for <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/nl-nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos I&O Netherlands</a>.
#second-paragraph: I grew up in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and after succesfully completing high school, I graduated with a bachelor in Psychology with a concentration in psychological methods and data science.

I intend to concentrate mostly on the use of computational techniques in the financial markets during my studies. In addition, I hope to gain a rich understanding of <hightlight>stochastic calculus</hightlight> and <hightlight>high performance computing</hightlight>. Since this is a two-year program, my anticipated graduation year is 2026. </p>  </td> </tr> </table>
